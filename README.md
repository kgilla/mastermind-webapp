# Mastermind

This is a website created as part of the Ruby/Ruby on Rails section of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). Mastermind is build using a combination of Ruby for game logic, [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com/) for backend routing, and Javascript to handle some basic responsive functions for layout. This website was my first foray into back-end frameworks and as such was more for education than for practical application.

## Learning Objectives

- Take an existing Ruby command line game and turn it into a more interactive, visual oriented experience.
- Gain a better understanding of Ruby backend framework [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com/).
- Learn about restful routes and how to apply them to applications.
- Use multiple languages in the same web application to handle various tasks.
- Further my understanding of CSS Grid and how to apply it with an object that needs to be rather static in composition (i.e. the gameboard).
